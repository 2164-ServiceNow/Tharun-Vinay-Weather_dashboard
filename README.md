# Project Title: WeatherWise - Personalized Weather Dashboard with Activity Recommendations

Project Description : WeatherWise is a personalized weather dashboard application that provides users with real-time weather    data based on their location. The app enhances the weather experience by suggesting relevant activities based on the current weather conditions. For instance, it can recommend outdoor activities like hiking or swimming during sunny weather or indoor activities like reading or visiting a museum during rainy weather. The application integrates multiple APIs to offer accurate weather details and activity recommendations.
